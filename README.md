Welcome to my GitHub portfolio! I’m an intermediate developer who is passionate about web development, game development, animating, 3D modeling and more. My portfolio includes a variety of work, from web development, app prototypes to game development. Each project taught me something and my dedication to continuous learning and improving my skills in these areas.
